            Hi! I'm Matthew Ragland, a computer science major at Rose-Hulman 
            Institute of Technology. This site is a showcase of the projects 
            I've worked on, and academic achievements I have made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computer programming has always fascinated me. My first 
            experience with coding was in 7th grade. As a part of a new 
            program we were all allowed to choose a topic to study, and I 
            chose programming. Although I started learning basic HTML and 
            CSS, by the end of the year I had created a game similar to Pong 
            from scratch. I loved the problem solving and creativity involved 
            in the task, and I knew I should persue the interest further.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I got the opportunity to take a computer science course in 
            high school I jumped at the opportunity. I quickly realized this 
            is what I wanted to have a career in, which led me to Rose.

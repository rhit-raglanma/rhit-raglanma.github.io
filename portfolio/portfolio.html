                <h2>Cypher</h2>
                <p>
                    My largest high school project was a cypher app for Apple 
                    devices. I created an app that would take in text, and 
                    both encode or decode it. At first I started with a basic 
                    Caesar Cypher, but I wanted a larger challenge. After 
                    looking at different encoding methods online, I decided 
                    to create a Nihilst Cypher. This uses a string of 5 
                    characters along with a message. Based on these 
                    characters, the message is encoded differently.

                <h2>CSSE 220 final project</h2>
                <p>
                    My final project in CSSE 220 was an arcade game with 
                    multiple levels, enemies, and a scoring system. I worked 
                    with a team to create this, everyone contributing and 
                    uploading their work to git. In addition to coding the 
                    game from scratch, we also created most of the visual 
                    art that was used in the game.
